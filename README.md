# Reproducing Experiments in "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate"

This is the code repository for the semester group project of the SS25 course ["Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing"](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=6291&dsrid=462&semester=2025S&courseNr=192039&dsrid=111) at the Technical University of Vienna. The project consists of reproducing the experimental results of the arXiv preprint "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho and Yoshua Bengio. The cited paper [1] has a corresponding GitHub repository [2] containing the code for the original experiments.
